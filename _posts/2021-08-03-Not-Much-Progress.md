In the last monts, there was very little progress in this project. Probably, it'll be like this for a while.

The annual field execerise in Pforzheim is canceled for the second time in a row this year. Still, the risk of
Covid-19 infections remains a major blocker for larger trainings, especially including actors.

Nevertheless, there is some progress. We had an online hackathon in March and we will continue to develop and refactor our codebase.
But not seeing a field deployment in the near future, there is no fixed release date or specific plan to implement a certain featureset.

Stay safe!
