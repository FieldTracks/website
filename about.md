Fieldtracks aims at building an open-source tracking systems for field exercises.
We are loosely coupled group of people based in North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Wuerttemberg.

Some of us have a background in Computer Science and Software Engineering, while others
come from different relief organizations.

We are neither state sponsored nor do we have commercial interests. Seeing the need for 
an affordable tracking system and being inspired by the engineering challenge of 
deploying an IoT-system in tactical manner we started working on this project.
