# The Fieldtracks Project

Fieldtracks implements localization and tracking for firefighters, medics & actors during field training exercises.
It is based on BLE, ESP32 and mesh networking; it focuses on both indoor and outdoor deployments.
For details see the recording of our talk at [FOSDEM 2020](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/iotfieldtracks/).
